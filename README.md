RASP
====

RASP stands for Regional Atmospheric Soaring Predictions. It's a service that allows you to check the wheaten for soaring purposes. 

This application makes the [RASP website](http://rasp.kzc.nl/) more accessible on iPhone and iPad.

This repo contains the code for the API website.

HOW
---

I made another [repo](http://github.com/fousa/rasp) with the iPhone application, in which I scrape the website and return the menu items with its links.

Go to the [heroku app](http://rasp.heroku.com/menu) and check the output.
